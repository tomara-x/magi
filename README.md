all is wip. there's a sequencer, parrallel frequency shift, distortion, granulator, spectral resonator, etc. you can test anything by going to the [faust ide](https://faustide.grame.fr/) and copying the code there. go to [vaporgirl repo](https://github.com/tomara-x/vaporgirl) for windows vst builds (feel free to request anything that's not there, i'll juce and upload it for you)
